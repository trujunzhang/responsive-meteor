This Privacy Policy governs our collection of information from you through your use of the Site. It does not apply to any information you may

                  <p className="s-p">
                      Like most website operators, Politicl collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Politicl’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Politicl’s
                      visitors use its website. From time to time, Politicl may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
                  </p>

                  <p className="s-p">
                      Politicl also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on our blogs. Politicl only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter
                      IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.

                      Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
                  </h2>

                  <p className="s-p">
                      Certain visitors to Politicl’s websites choose to interact with Politicl in ways that require Politicl to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Politicl gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who comment on our blog to provide a username and email address. Those who wish to receive Politicl
                      updates via email, we collect their emails. In each case, Politicl collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Politicl. Politicl does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with
                      the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

                      Politicl may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Politicl may monitor the most popular pages on the Politicl.com site or use spam screened by the Akismet service to help identify spam. Politicl may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Politicl does not disclose personally-identifying information other
                      than as described below.

                      Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

                  <p className="s-p">
                      Politicl discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Politicl’s behalf or to provide services available at Politicl’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those
                      employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Politicl’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Politicl will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as
                      described above, Politicl discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Politicl believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Politicl, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user
                      of an Politicl website and have supplied your email address, Politicl may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Politicl and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum.
                      If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Politicl takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially
                      personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

                      A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Politicl uses cookies to help Politicl identify and track visitors, their usage of Politicl website, and their website access preferences. Politicl visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their
                      computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Politicl’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Politicl’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements
                      that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Politicl and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
