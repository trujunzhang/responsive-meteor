** Issue #22: Also, description should be in a text box. Doesnt look editable right now. 

** TODO Issue #21: When you're on the home page and you click on politicl (which is supposed to take you to the home page), nothing happens. There should be a quick loader/some animation to show you've refreshed.

   [12/23/16, 6:26:20 PM] Sid Karwal: When I am on the homepage “scruby.site”, and I click “Politicl logo”, the articles are refreshed. But the user does not know the articles have been refreshed.
